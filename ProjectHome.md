We here at Team ESO have quite a few plugins in store for everybody. The drive behind our plugin choices are to promote the player ecosystem that we have on our server. And that is the primary focus for these plugins.

That said, we do code with other servers in mind, so that we can release these plugins to the general public to enhance their servers in similar ways. We love what minecraft has become and believe that the modding community for SMP is a vital part of why minecraft is what it is today.

Here are the list of proposed plugins that Team ESO intends to create.

### [EpicZones](EpicZones.md) ###
Polygon based area protection, with child zones, permissions inheritance, and map border protection.

### [EpicGates](EpicGates.md) ###
Static linked teleportation with multi-world management.

### [EpicEconomy](EpicEconomy.md) ###
Provide a simple easy to configure, yet robust currency framework. That provides the basic functionality of an economy system. And an interface for other plugins to build upon.

### [EpicManagement](EpicManagement.md)(discontinued) ###
Provide basic server management. /kick, /ban and a permissions driven whitelist, to name some of the key points.
