#summary Polygon based area protection, with child zones, permissions inheritance, and map border protection.

== Introduction ==
Polygon based area protection, with child zones, permissions inheritance, and map border protection. 

*Lead Developer* jblaske


== Features ==
    * Polygonal area creation. (Not just cuboids!)
    * In-game zone creation.
    * Provide a Circular border to your map.
    * Hierarchical Permissions with Child and Parent Zones.
    * Utilizes Permissions for zone rights.
    * Display Entering and Exiting messages in chat.
    * Enhanced /who


== Default Config.yml ==
{{{
defaultEnter: true
defaultDestroy: true
defaultBuild: true
mapRadius: 1000
enableRadius: true
}}}
 * Default permissions are used, when nothing is specified for any given user/group.


== Example Zones.txt ==
{{{
#Zone Tag|World|Zone Name|Flags|Enter Message|Exit Message|Floor|Ceiling|Child Zones|PointList
test1|world1|Test Zone 1|pvp:false regen:false nomobs:false|Entering Test Zone 1...|Leaving Test Zone 1...|0|128|test2 |-20:20 20:20 20:-20 -20:-20
test2|world1|Test Zone 2|pvp:false regen:false nomobs:false|Entering Test Zone 2...|Leaving Test Zone 2...|0|128||-10:10 10:10 10:-10 -10:-10
}}}
 * Regen and NoMobs have no effect currently, and do not need to be specified.
 * ZoneTag must be unique.


== Creating Zones In Game ==
Use the /zone command at any time for in game help.

Example for creating a zone in game.
{{{
/zone create arena
}}}
You are then put into draw mode, use the zoneTool in your config (Default is Stick) to right click and set points. When you are done.

When a zone is created, its Name is defaulted to the tag, and its world is defaulted to the world you are in. Both can be changed after drawing your polygon.
{{{
/zone save
/zone name PvP Arena
/zone flag pvp true
/zone enter PVP is enabled, beware!
/zone exit You are no longer in a pvp zone, you can relax now
/zone save
}}}
And your zone is done!

Be sure to set your new zone as a child on any zones it is within like this:
{{{
/zone edit parentzone
/zone addchildren arena
/zone save
}}}
Currently, you cannot add permissions from within game, you must modify your permissions config.yml manually.

== Map Radius ==
Map radius, when enabled will prevent players from travling outside of the fixed range from 0,0 on the map.

To allow a player to ignore the map radius add this to their permissions
{{{epiczones.ignoremapradius}}}

== Permissions Explained ==
EpicZones is fully integrated with Permissions, to define who can do what within zones. This allows permissions to properly inherit from groups and also allow for specific permissions for players.

To give a player permissions to do things in a zone, you add a permission to that player's group or the player specifically in the form of epiczones.zonetag.flag

So, if you wanted joebob to have build access in test1, listed above. You would add the following permission to joebob's permissions.
{{{epiczones.test1.build}}}
It's that simple!

Now you wonder, how do i specifically deny somebody from doing things now? Easy just add .deny to the end! This would deny build permissions in test1.
{{{epiczones.test1.build.deny}}}
NOTE: Deny permissions take precedence over allow permissions. Child permissions take precedence over parent permissions.

If you would like a member to be able to ignore all zone permissions add this to their permissions
{{{epiczones.ignorepermissions}}}


== Possible Permission Flags ==
    * build
      * The placement of blocks and pouring of buckets
    * destroy
      * The destruction of blocks and the scooping of buckets
    * entry
      * Player walk or teleport within a zone.

== Flags ==
    * PVP
      * You must have PVP enabled in your server.properties file
      * Setting pvp:true in a zone, will allow players to damage each other.
      * When checking for pvp allowance, it checks the zone of the player being damaged, not the player dealing the damage.


== Commands ==
    * /who (epiczones.who)
    * /reloadez (epiczones.admin)
    * /zone (epiczones.admin)
